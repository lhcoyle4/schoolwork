* the steps in the USB enumeration process
  - device connected
  - reset signal sent to device from host
  - data rate determined during reset signalling
  - device information read by host and device assigned unique 7-bit address
  - if device supported, drivers for communication are loaded
  - device set to configured state and communication begins
  - if usb host restarted, enumeration repeated for all devices

* the USB packet types and token types
  - each transaction consists of
    - token packet generated by host to describe what is to follow, whether the data       transaction will be read or write and the device's address and designated endpoint is
    - data packet carrying payload
    - handshake packet, reporting if data was received successfully, or if endpoint is stalled
  - there are also SOF start of frame packets, consisting of 11 bit frame number, sent every   1ms by host on full speed bus, or every 125us on high speed bus
  - all packets start with sync field (8 bits low speed, 32 bits high speed)
    - used to synchronize clock between rx and tx, last two bits indicate where PID starts
  - PID is packet ID, identifies type of packet being sent
    - possible values include
      - token (OUT, IN, SOF, SETUP)
      - data (DATA0, DATA1, DATA2, MDATA)
      - handshake (ACK, NAK, STALL, NYET (no response yet))
      - special (PREamble, ERR, Split, Ping)
    - there are 4 bits to the PID, but they are complemented in repeated, resulting in 8
  - ADDR field specifies which device packet is for, 7 bits in length. Address 0 for unassigned     devices
  - ENDP endpoint field made up of 4 bits, allowing 16 possible endpoints, low speed only have   2 additional endpoints on top of the default pipe
  - CRC cyclic redundancy checks are performed on the data within the packet payload, all token   packets have 5 bit CRC, while data packets have 16 bit CRC
  - EOP signalled by a SE0 (single ended zero) for approximately 2 bit times followed by a J     for 1 bit time

* the standards for how much power is provided by a USB socket
  - 5V DC signal
  - Max voltage 5 +- 0.25V (pre 3.0)
  - 5 +- 0.25 to 0.55V (USB 3.0)
  - Max current 0.5 to 0.9A (general)
  - 500mA to 1500mA (charging devices)
    - charging downstream port limited to 900mA so as to not interfere with high speed data
  - 90Ohm +- 15% characteristic impedance

* the difference between a USB host and USB hub
  - there is only one host, which is itself a hub, called the root hub
  - another hub may be connected to the root hub
    - # of transaction translators (per port/per hub) differs
      - per hub = one full/low speed bus to all devices on up
      - per port = isolated full/low speed buses for each port on hub
